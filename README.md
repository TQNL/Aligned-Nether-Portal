Nether portals will spawn on the exact coordinates in the nether with the same configuration. For reference, X and Z coordinates are divided by 8 in the nether. If the nether portal if made below y=0, the portal will spawn at y=5 in the nether (to avoid bedrock breaking).

This data pack is handy for having portals be separate from other portals, so that there is no unintentional cross-linking.
